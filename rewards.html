					<h3>Rewards Programs &mdash; Keep Them Coming Back <em>with Your App</em></h3>
					<h4>Free pizza. Bonus points. Cheesy incentives they can't resist.</h4>
					<h4>When your customers know they're getting rewarded every time they order, they'll keep coming back — and your ovens will stay busy.</h4>
				</hgroup>
			</div>
			
			<section>
				<h5>Turn First-Time Customers into Regulars</h5>
				<div>
					<p>With your app's built-in rewards program, every order puts points in your customers' pockets.</p>
					<p>They watch their points add up — and when they're close to a free pizza, they're not ordering from anyone else.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Instant Gratification</h5>
				<div>
					<p>No punch cards to lose. No confusing rules.</p>
					<p>Customers open your app, see their points balance, and know exactly how close they are to their next reward.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;You're just 15 points away from FREE Breadsticks!&rdquo;</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Deals That Feel Like Gifts</h5>
				<div>
					<p>Your app lets you send surprise rewards to keep customers excited:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Birthday Freebies</strong> &mdash; a free dessert or breadsticks on their special day.</li>
						<li><strong>VIP Status</strong> &mdash; extra points for your top spenders.</li>
						<li><strong>Double Points Days</strong> &mdash; drive big spikes in orders during slow periods.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>You Control the Rules</h5>
				<div>
					<p>Set how points are earned, what rewards you offer, and when they're redeemed.</p>
					<p>Run limited-time reward boosts to encourage bigger orders and repeat visits.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Track Loyalty Like a Pro</h5>
				<div>
					<p>Your app's dashboard shows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Who your top customers are.</li>
						<li>How often they order.</li>
						<li>Which rewards bring them back fastest.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</section>

			<div class="bottomline">
				<h5>The Bottom Line</h5>
				<p>With your app, rewards aren't just freebies — they're a proven way to keep customers loyal, increase order frequency, and make sure your name is the first one they think of when they're hungry.</p>
