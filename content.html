			<h3>Indie Pizza Legends: Your Time Has Come!</h3>
			<p>Tired of losing a slice of your dough to third-party apps? PizzaNow! gives you your own app to run your shop your way.</p>

Let's face it, you have the competitive advantage as part of your local community! Not to mention your pizza is 1000% better!</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Online orders are typically twice the size of walk in orders</li>
				<li>Chains put locations near you and take your customers with technology</li>
				<li>Consumers order where it's easy</li>
				<li>Big chains have spent millions on loyalty programs because they work!</li>
				<li>Technology has not been achievable for small pizza shops until now!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Grandma's meatball recipe deserves more than a 30% commission fee.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No tech degree required</li>
				<li>Setup in minutes</li>
				<li>$0 upfront—only 3% per order</li>
