					<h3>From Dough to Digital</h3>
					<h4>How Growing Up in a Pizza Shop Led to Building PizzaNow!</h4>
				</hgroup>
			</div>
			<section>
				<p>I didn't just grow up around pizza, I grew up in a pizza shop. My mom and stepdad started their journey in the food world by buying into a franchise called <em>Plus One Pizza</em>. At first, it felt like the fast track to the American Dream: a ready-made brand, structured systems, and a roadmap to success.</p>
				<p>But the reality was very different. The franchise had full control over pricing, forcing us to buy ingredients at marked-up rates. As costs rose, our freedom and profits shrank. It wasn't sustainable. So, we made a courageous decision, one that would change the course of our lives. We broke away and started our own independent shop: <em>Just Pizza</em>.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Just Pizza&rdquo; wasn't just a name; it was a statement. No corporate red tape. No overpriced supply chains. Just real, honest pizza made by a family for our community. I grew up inside those four walls, making dough, folding boxes after school, and learning customer service from the most welcoming woman I know: my mom.</p>
				<p>The shop doesn't exist anymore, but the lessons I learned there never left me. In fact, they became the foundation for something bigger.</p>
				<p>That something is <strong>PizzaNow!</strong></p>
				<p><strong>PizzaNow!</strong> is a tech platform built by people who understand pizza, not just how to make it, but what it takes to run a shop, serve a community, and stay afloat in a competitive market. We created PizzaNow! because we saw firsthand how small pizza shops struggle to compete with big chains that have the tech, the marketing budgets, and the delivery infrastructure.</p>
				<p><strong>PizzaNow! levels the playing field.</strong></p>
				<p>It's an all-in-one app that helps independent pizza shops manage online orders, streamline delivery, reach new customers, and grow, without giving up their independence or profits. No hidden fees. No gatekeeping. Just powerful tools designed for local shops by people who lived that life.</p>
				<p>Our goal isn't just to help you sell more pizza, but it's to help you succeed as a business. Because behind every local pizzeria is a story just like ours: one of resilience, love, and community.</p>
				<p>So while <em>Just Pizza</em> may no longer serve pizzas, its legacy lives on in every shop we empower through <strong>PizzaNow!</strong></p>
				<p>Because when you grow up in a place like that, you don't just learn how to make pizza. <strong>You learn how to build something that lasts</strong>.</p>
