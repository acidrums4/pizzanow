				<p>Picture this: the high school band needs new uniforms. The fire department's hosting a charity drive. The local animal shelter's raising funds.</p>
				<p>And <em>your</em> pizza shop becomes the hero that makes it happen.</p>
				<p>With your app, fundraising isn't just a good deed &mdash; it's a sales event that gets the whole town ordering from you.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4>Community Craves a Cause</h4>
				<p>People love supporting their neighbors. With your app, you can run special fundraising nights where a portion of every order goes to a cause &mdash; and your customers can see it, tap it, and order instantly.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4>Easy for You. Powerful for Them.</h4>
				<p>No stacks of paper forms. No collecting checks. No chasing down orders.</p>
				<p>Your app handles everything online:</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Customers order like normal.</li>
				    <li>You track the sales in real time.</li>
				    <li>The fundraiser gets the support they need.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Get Approved in Minutes</h4>
				<p>Here's the best part &mdash; groups don't have to wait weeks to get started.</p>

				<p>That means they can:</p>

				    <li>Start promoting the event that same day.</li>
				    <li>Get the word out through your app's push notifications and in-app banners.</li>
				</ul>
				<hr>
				<h4>You Become the Local Legend</h4>
				<p>When people see you helping the school, the sports team, or the local heroes, they don't forget. They'll tell their friends. They'll keep coming back. And the cause will bring in <em>new</em> customers who haven't ordered from you before.</p>
				<hr>
				<h4>Built-In Publicity</h4>
				<p>Push notifications. In-app banners. Special &ldquo;Fundraiser Menu&rdquo; items.</p>
				<p>Your app makes sure everyone knows about the cause &mdash; and how easy it is to support it just by ordering dinner.</p>

					<dd>With your app, you're not just selling pizza &mdash; you're fueling the community. Every slice, every order, every fundraiser turns into more loyalty, more sales, and more love for your shop. And now, anyone can get their fundraiser approved and live &mdash; starting today.</dd>
