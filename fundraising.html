			<h3>Raise Dough. Raise Spirits. Raise Your Sales &mdash; <em>with Your App</em></h2>
			<p>Picture this: the high school band needs new uniforms. The fire department's hosting a charity drive. The local animal shelter's raising funds.</p>
			<p>And <em>your</em> pizza shop becomes the hero that makes it happen.</p>
			<p>With your app, fundraising isn't just a good deed &mdash; it's a sales event that gets the whole town ordering from you.</p>
			<hr>
			<h4>Community Craves a Cause</h4>
			<p>People love supporting their neighbors. With your app, you can run special fundraising nights where a portion of every order goes to a cause &mdash; and your customers can see it, tap it, and order instantly.</p>

			</ul>

			<hr>
			<h4>Built-In Publicity</h4>
			<p>Push notifications. In-app banners. Special &ldquo;Fundraiser Menu&rdquo; items.</p>
			<p>Your app makes sure everyone knows about the cause &mdash; and how easy it is to support it just by ordering dinner.</p>
